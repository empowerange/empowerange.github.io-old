How did Empowerange came into existence?
In August 2018, Jaydeep Borkar, then a third-year undergraduate student, learnt about a lot of problems faced by the different sections of the society and how NGOs are making a difference. He remained fascinated to solve these problems using computer science, which eventually led him to start Empowerange, with his friend Santosh Vijapure.
